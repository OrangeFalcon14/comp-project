## About the game:

Welcome to CodeQuest, a game where you learn to code by directly modifying the game’s source code to overcome challenges! At first, the game seems impossible—traps block your path, platforms are missing, and enemies are too strong. But instead of just playing, you’ll dive into the game’s actual code to fix problems, remove obstacles, and even tweak game mechanics to progress. You’ll start with small changes, like adjusting variables or fixing broken conditions, and gradually take on more complex tasks, such as modifying loops or writing functions to solve puzzles. By the end of the game, you won’t just have completed a fun adventure—you’ll have learned the basics of programming, debugging, and problem-solving in a hands-on way.

## Instructions:

- Before you start the game, ensure you have the following installed:
  - a code editor installed. eg. VSCode
  - Python version 3.13
- Next, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
